## About Myself:
I used to work as an engineer in a construction laboratory. The work consisted in laboratory control of building materials. I have technical experience that always helps me.
And now for 9 years I'm working as a swimming coach for preschoolers and children with special needs. This job gave me great inspiration (thanks to the children) to learn new things.
I think that the combination of my past experience helps me to make a good products and be a good employee.
